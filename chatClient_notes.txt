default export
named export _ using curly braces, with the same name as the file

// when using styled components, we can use the css prop to apply styles

when handling css using string, we use lower case for the property names, and hyphenate(-) them, also give semicolon at the end
Just like css files
// e.g. 
    const Component = styled(Box)`
    height: 100vh;
    background: #DCDCDC;
`

when handling css using object, we use camelCase for the property names
// e.g. 
    const dialogStyle = { // object to style the dialog
        height: '95%',
        width: '60%',
        maxHeight: '100',
    }

If you want to send data along with a request
get Request _ pass params as options, at the backend receive it as  req.query.
Post Request _ req.body.
dynamic part _ received in backend as :id _ req.params.id

------- Final Changes:-------

conversation.jsx
on production level, change it to backend link

In AccountProvider.jsx, the socket link is hard-coded, it may need to be changed to the backend link on production level.
